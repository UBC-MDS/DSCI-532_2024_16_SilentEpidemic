# The Slient Epidemic: National Drug Overdose Deaths
Dash dashboard visualizing America's drug overdose death rates. The dashboard can be found here (insert built dashboard link - milestone 2).

## Dashboard Purpose: 
The SilentEpidemic dashboard was created as a teaching tool for high school students in California. It is intended to raise awareness for the increasing rate of drug overdose deaths within the general population and within the 15-24 age group. The dashboard highlights the discrepancies in drug overdose deaths by ethnicity and gender, and also shows the rise in opioid-related deaths over time.
