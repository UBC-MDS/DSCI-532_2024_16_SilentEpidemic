# Section 2: Description of the Data
In response to Dr. Darling's concern and NIDA's commitment to addressing the surge in drug overdose fatalities, We will visualize data on National Drug Overdose Deaths from 1999 to 2021, drawn from the CDC WONDER database. The dataset provides detailed information on overdose deaths across the United States, categorized by drug type and demographic variables, and is a rich resource for understanding the evolving landscape of drug overdose fatalities.

Key components of the dataset include:

1. Overall Overdose Death Counts and Rates: The total counts of drug overdose deaths are presented alongside age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population, highlighting the escalation in drug overdose deaths, to stress the urgency of informed preventative education. The age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 population facilitate a comparative analysis over time, despite demographic shifts. This dataset contains approximately 204 rows and 24 columns.

2. Age-Specific Overdose Data: Specifically targeting the 15-24 age demographic, the data offer insights into overdose deaths within this younger cohort, crucial for informing early prevention and educational initiatives. This subset includes around 130 rows and 24 columns.

3. Demographic-Specific Overdose Rates: Further, the dataset breaks down overdose death rates by demographic categories such as gender and ethnicity, age-adjusted per 100,000 population, ensuring our dashboard is tailored to addresss specific educational needs. It includes approximately 83 rows and 24 columns.

The primary variables that will drive our visual analysis include:

- Year: Temporal variable to illustrate time patterns, spanning from 1999 to 2021
- Gender: Categorical variable to draw out disparities in drug misuse impacts between males and females.
- Drug Categories: Categorical variable to elucidate the differential dangers they pose, including Any Opioid, Prescription Opioids, Heroin, Synthetic Opioids (other than Methadone, primarily fentanyl), Stimulants, Cocaine, and others.

A new variable, the 'Proportion of Deaths by Drug Type,' will be introduced to ascertain the most lethal drugs by taking the number of deaths attributable to each drug type and dividing it by the total number of overdose deaths. This metric will allow us to emphasize the disproportionate danger of certain substances, such as fentanyl, in our educational outreach.

Ideally, we would also have data on the educational backgrounds of individuals who succumbed to overdoses to directly link educational interventions to potential reductions in mortality rates. Although we can't engineer this from the available data, it would provide a more concrete foundation for our program's impact assessment.

Our visualizations aim to shed light on trends and changes in drug overdose deaths over the years. This crucial information directly addresses the concerns of our audience and aid healthcare professionals, policymakers, educators, and community leaders in developing targeted interventions and educational programs to prevent drug misuse and overdose, especially among youth, thereby aligning with NIDA's mission and Dr. Darling's objectives for the California State Board of Education.
