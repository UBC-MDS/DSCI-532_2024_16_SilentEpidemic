# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose
## 1. Target Audience & Your Role:
**Our Role**: Researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)

**Target Audience**: Dr. Linda Darling, State Board President, California State Board of Education

## 2. Problem & Importance:
Dr. Darling and our group are concerned about the alarming rise in national drug overdose deaths and want to provide additional education for upper high school students. This is crucial because:
- Drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl have increased significantly in recent years (https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/health/overdose-deaths-record-high-fentanyl/index.html)
- Many overdoses are unintentional, often occurring because people underestimate the dangers of mixing drugs (https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/fentanyl-driving-overdoses)
- Effective education programs can equip students with the knowledge and skills to identify the risks of different drugs and recognize the signs and symptoms of overdose. (https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/factsheet_educator_what_educators_can_do.pdf)

## 3. How Our Dashboard Helps:
Our dashboard would be able to picture the following:
- Overdose Trends: Show a clear upward trend in national drug overdose deaths over time, particularly focusing on the rise in synthetic opioid-related deaths.
- Drug Risk Comparisons: Visually represent the relative risks associated with different drug categories, highlighting the dangers of synthetic opioids compared to other substances.
- Demographic Disparities: Highlight potential risk factors by ethnicity and gender to identify high-risk student populations.
